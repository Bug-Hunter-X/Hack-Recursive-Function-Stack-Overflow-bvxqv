# Hack Recursive Function Stack Overflow

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: the lack of a base case for negative input, resulting in a stack overflow.

The `bug.hh` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.hh` file provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering all possible input values when writing recursive functions and including appropriate checks to prevent infinite recursion.
